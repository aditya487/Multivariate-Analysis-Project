# Multivariate Analysis Project

This project contains a detailed multivariate analysis of milk traits data using R. The analysis was originally performed as part of the STAT40150 Multivariate Analysis course. 

## Overview

The focus of this project is on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and handling missing values in the dataset. The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing milk traits data for the year 2023.

## Files in this Repository

- `Multivariate_Analysis.Rmd`: This is the original R Markdown file that contains the code for the analysis.
- `Multivariate_Analysis.md`: This is the Markdown file generated from the R Markdown file. It contains the code and outputs of the analysis. Click [here](./Multivariate_Analysis.md) to view the detailed analysis.
- `README.md`: This is the file you're currently reading. It provides an overview of the project.

## Running the Code

To run the analysis on your own machine, you will need to have R installed. You can then clone this repository and open the `Multivariate_Analysis.Rmd` file in your R environment. To clone this repository, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
